You can contribute in a variety of ways:

* You can submit resources related to classes of different _Online Education_ initiatives. Right now, you can [contact using email](http://amberj.github.com/online-edu-resources/contact.html "Contact") for the same. We are planning to use some sort of submission system (something like [Google Moderator](http://www.google.com/moderator/ "Google Moderator") or [Google Docs Form](http://www.google.com/google-d-s/forms/ "Google Docs Forms")) so that site visitors can submit and vote useful resources.

* You can help with the development and maintainence of site. You need to be able to use [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ "Markdown"), [git](http://git-scm.com/ "git") and [GitHub](https://github.com/ "GitHub") to help out with site. If yes, [contact via email](http://amberj.github.com/online-edu-resources/contact.html "Contact").
